Hi!

My name is Oleg Pittman--a fact that likely is not that surprising to you since you've stumbled onto this site. I am currently a student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), slaving away to get my Masters in Computer Science. I read books, listen to all sorts of music, and--some would say--tend to be highly opinionated. Oh. And I'm blind. Thought I'd mention that since that seems like a somewhat important detail.

Every now and then I thought to myself, "Wouldn't having a blog be cool? That's what the modern kids do, right?" Well, I don't know about it being modern nowadays, but there it is. I have no idea how often this will be updated, but at least now when I wake up in the middle of the night thinking, "Man, what a weird dream that was about pretzels," you, my dear reader, will have the (debatable) fortune of also experiencing the world domination of them yeast krakens.

!!! note
    Yes, that did happen. No, I do not hate pretzels, nor do I seriously think they're going to take over. The cats, on the other hand...

I am not exactly certain as to what I will blog about here--anything goes, as they say. Maybe I will clean up and restructure my notes from [the](https://mcmil.net/wordpress/2023/10/24/cs-371d-distributed-computing/) [variety](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/courses/fa23/index.html) [of](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/courses/353-theory-computation) [courses](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/cs378h/) I've taken over the years. Maybe I will rave about a [new series](https://www.amazon.com/Abercrombie-Collection-Itself-Before-Argument/dp/9124114812). Or perhaps I will simply reflect upon life and the inconsequentiality of our actions on planet Earth.
